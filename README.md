This PDE-based project models pollution dispersion in a two-dimensional environment using the advection-diffusion equation. It simulates how pollutants spread over time due to wind-driven transport (advection) and molecular mixing (diffusion). Using finite difference methods, it solves the governing equations numerically, enabling visualization of pollutant concentration across a grid. The project helps analyze how emission sources, wind velocity, and diffusion coefficients affect environmental contamination. Itâ€™s ideal for understanding air quality modeling and environmental impact assessment.
